# Arranging History

What allows individuals to connect historical events in both time and location? For example, when and where was JFK assasinated and how does that relate in time and location to Amelia Earhart's dissappearance.  So often historical events are taught in isolation.  Now with Arranging History historical evants are introduced in an interactive manner combing timelines, maps, wikipedia pages and youtube videos.
